Nucamp - Nahal, David, Zach build blackjack with JS, Bootstrap, CSS, API (deck of cards)

# We will be working with the deck of cards API https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/

# Technology used: Javascript, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS

# Overview
In this course, and in all of your Nucamp courses, you will be expected to develop a personal project alongside your course work. Your project should showcase the skills you are currently learning (JavaScript, in this case), and be of sufficient quality to add to your professional portfolio and share with potential employers. We will refer to this project throughout the course as your "portfolio project" to distinguish it from any class projects.

You should consider your project as a sandbox for you to put into practice everything you are learning. Along the way, you'll try new things, break a lot of things, and learn a lot as you figure out how to put it back together.

Your project is due at the end of "Project Week", which is the week between Week 5 of this course and Week 1 of your next course, React.



Project Requirements
Here are the requirements for your JavaScript project, at a minimum:

This should be completed as a GROUP project, with at least 2 and not more than 4 people in your group.  All of the members of your group should be in the same cohort.  If for any reason you are unable to complete this project as part of a group, please discuss your concerns and alternatives with your instructor.
You will work with your partners to create a Javascript-based app with an attractive UI that is either:
An original game (not from a tutorial), OR
An original app using a 3rd party API (such as a weather app, funny animal gifs, stock prices, or movie listings)
Your project should use HTML5, CSS or SCSS, Bootstrap 4 or 5, and vanilla JavaScript.
Your finished project should have a GitHub repository with a readme file, and be deployed with a public URL.
Your project is due at the end of "Project Week" (the week between week 5 of this course and the start of your next course). You will submit your project in a class forum for peer review, and give feedback on 2 other projects.
All students should seek peer feedback from classmates throughout the development process, and use the feedback to guide your design decisions.

Objectives for This Week
The first step in your journey towards the implementation of your project begins with putting a team together, deciding what you will build, and articulating what your application will offer for its users.

This week, you will begin brainstorming some ideas about what you might want to do for your project, identify partners to work on a project with you, and meet with your partners to discuss the different options you all have brainstormed so that you can narrow down your choices to just two or three options for further research. You can use Zoom, Discord, or any platform you prefer to meet with your group partners.

Next, you will define the purpose for your application and a set of expected features. You will also survey the market to look at similar ideas to enable you to differentiate your project from others, while at the same time drawing inspiration from them.

While it's fun to daydream about all of the cool features your website will have, it's very important to manage the scope of the project in a way that you can complete it on time, get useful feedback from your peers and your instructor, and be able to improve on it in subsequent iterations.  In agile development methodology, this idea of starting with something simple is called creating a "Minimum Viable Product", or MVP.  We'll be referring to the MVP often throughout your bootcamp.

Your MVP design should include just the bare minimum of whatever it takes for your website to be useful to someone. Everything else you'd like to have can be listed as extra features, and you can work on them as you have time after your MVP is complete. Your goal is to have at least a complete, working MVP ready to demo in your Week 5 workshop, and then you will continue to improve on the MVP as you have time during this course and during the Project Week between courses.



Where do you begin?

Think about and brainstorm some possible project ideas that seem interesting to you
Put together a team of 2-4 people. You can invite people to join you, or you can reach out to your classmates to ask if anyone needs someone else to join them.
Meet with your partners to discuss the ideas you all have brainstormed. Narrow down the options to just 2 or 3 ideas.
Do some preliminary research on each of the final ideas, and decide together which one you are going to work on.
With your partners, start drafting a list of the MVP requirements for your project, along with a list of "Nice to Have" features you can add when your MVP is complete.  Your MVP may evolve slightly over time, but it's best to try to delineate your MVP goals as clearly as possible from the very beginning, so that you don't waste time. Research similar apps online for some ideas.


By the end of this week, you should be able to:

Clearly express the central idea of your project
Delineate a set of features that you expect your app should support, and at which stage of the development process (in the MVP or later)
Identify other projects that might have similar features and would act as exemplars for your project
